Maria Reimer, Daniel Seitz and Paula Glaser work with heart and soul for the youth program "Jugend hackt", which served as a template for this manual. "Jugend hackt" is organized by the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany e.V. and mediale pfade.org - Association for Media Education. The Open Knowledge Foundation Germany is committed to free knowledge and is helping build digital infrastructure for civil activism. Mediale Pfade develops innovative concepts for new media paths of learning and participation.

Maria started "Jugend hackt" at the beginning of 2013 after observing that there are too few non-profit educational and meeting offerings for the post-Snowden generation. A few months later Daniel, with his many years of experience in the field of media pedagogy, came across technology-driven work. Paula has joined the team after re:publica 2014 with a great scientific work, which shows the impact of "Jugend hackt", and has increased the bus factor of the core team to 3. (In the programming world, the bus factor refers to the number of people who have to be hit by a bus in order to eliminate the knowledge of a process or a project.)
