The team should reflect the diversity that is also desired for the event. At the core, it needs three different roles, some of which can overlap. In order to get the whole event on the road, an **organization team** needs to coordinate the entire team and the process, make central decisions and connect all groups. The organization team is best formed of people who are concerned with the consequences of technology and digitization, civil society, or who are at least open-minded in regards to new technologies. The organization team should also take care of - or at least coordinate - fundraising, public relations and press work as well as the design of the event. The exact tasks are described in "Chapter 3 - Phases".
 
In addition, there is a **(media) pedagogical team**, i.e. specialists who can plan and shape learning processes and the relationships between mentors and participants. Their task is to conceive, in particular, the different elements of the event, the general objectives and the handling of the results. They should also educate the mentors and enable them to safely interact and deal with young people. During the event, it is their duty to keep an eye on all young people, to support them, and to advise mentors on educational matters. The (media) pedagogues should have very good technical skills - they do not necessarily have to be able to program themselves, but should be able to speak the mentor's language or possess basic knowledge in technical skills (*netiquette, hacker ethics, open data* etc.) as well as have an idea of ​​the target group and their needs.

The core of the offer is the **mentors** - the event depends on them, as they are both professional and emotional anchor points for the participants. A great motivation for mentors is that they help provide an offering they wished existed in their own childhoods.  
In order to make their voluntary commitment as easy as possible, the effort required from them should be kept as low as possible before and after the event.

We choose mentors for "Jugend hackt" according to different criteria. A central criterion is their ability to engage with fellow human beings and their willingness to support young people in independent, self-fulfilling learning. Furthermore, depending on the target group of the hackathon, the demands on the technical skills are also great because the young people represent a broad spectrum of formal knowledge, programming languages ​​and hardware interests.
Suitable mentors are often found for example in the vicinity of the Chaos Computer Club, where civil society commitment and high technical competence are combined. There are also the "OK Labs" of the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany as well as other *hack spaces* and *meetups* in many cities.

In the search for mentors, a clear concept and clear goals help the mentor to identify with the endeavor - especially the mentors one is keen to inspire are usually very critical of economic and governmental structures. It is important to build trust to keep things moving over a longer period of time.
