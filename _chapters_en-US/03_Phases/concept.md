The concept alone does not make for a good youth hackathon. But a good youth hackathon is impossible without a concept.

A concept normally conveys a sense of security and control over the format. This is where the concept for a youth hackathon may differ from other formats of youth (media) work, for it is an integral part of a youth hackathon to relieve control over the results of the event. With this release of control, a youth hackathon most closely approximates the barcamp format, wherein only the initial conditions and process – but not the result – is defined. "I would like to organize a youth hackathon where apps for the safer internet use by children are created," is assuredly the wrong approach. "I would like to organize a youth hackathon with a theme of safe internet use," is much better.

When designing a concept, it is first necessary to define goals. In doing so, one’s own goals differ from the objectives of the event. Own goals could be:

* To familiarize yourself with the format of the hackathon,
* To take the format as an occasion to expand your own network,
* To offer a format for networking and personal development for personally known, technically experienced young people.

In order to define the objectives of the event, the following questions could be asked and answered:

* What is a socially relevant topic that interests young people?
* When is the event successful? (This does not have to be quantitative criteria such as the participant number, but the success can also be related to learning curves of the participants or to the quality of the ideas translated etc.)
* How can I make youthful perspectives on my subject (e.g. environmental education) visible and promote engagement in this area?

While answering the questions about one’s own goals, the most important question automatically answers itself: Is a hackathon the right format for my goals? In fact, this is the first and most important prerequisite question to answer. At this point, one has to ask oneself honestly: is the desire for the event wishful thinking - or does it really exist? In case of doubt, it is advisable to start with a pilot, or to remain in the technical language, to carry out an "alpha" version and to decide whether "alpha" is buried or continued as a "beta".

Once it is clear that the format is the right one, it is important to define the theme of the event. What are the young people interested in? What problems do they want to solve? Is it the major social issues (such as environmental protection, health care, net neutrality, anti-racism) that are relevant to the envisioned target group? Or is it a set of local issues that can be solved with existing data and technology?
From the thematic orientation comes the name for the youth hackathon - important criteria should be intelligibility, but also availability of the domain name, the Twitter account, and so on.
             
Optionally, specific challenges for the hackathon can be formulated. This is often done for adult hackathons to increase the chances for outputs that exactly fit pre-requirements, e.g. for further use on solutions within the organizing company. In the case of youth hackathons, however, this approach can just as well hinder the participation and activity levels. Self-initiative within general subject areas is commonly perceived as a big win by young people. From school, they are often not used to working independently with an open outcome, which can initially lead to disorientation within the framework of a hackathon. However, you should be able to endure this uncertainty in order to allow the participants an enormously important realization: "What I am not doing does not happen. Only what I'm doing actually happens.” This self-empowerment is a tremendously important learning experience.

Determining the thematic orientation can only be done in accordance with the description of the target group in order to produce a viable concept. In this way, the main focus is on the areas of interest that actually align with those of the young people. In the best case, the target group itself is involved in the topic-finding process in order to ensure that the participants one wants for the event will actually participate.

In order to outline the desired target group, the following question should be asked during the conceptual phase: What personalities and what interests do I want to see at my event? The sketching of different *personas*, i.e. the construction of idealized participants, is a suitable way to answer this. These *personas* (2–5 recommended) should cover the bandwidth of the desired target group, to ensure that the potentially interested parties are later reached.

Another component of the event concept is the definition of a set of quantitative variables. First of all, the number of participants, which is best determined after dealing with the description of the target group. There is not the one right size for a youth hackathon. However, we recommend a minimum size of 20 participants to participate in group processes at all, and to allow the implementation of more than one or two project ideas. In addition, a youth hackathon is also a very social event, which should bring the participants into contact with like-minded people. The number of participants is basically unlimited. In the spirit of piloting, however, the first event should not be too large. Ultimately, the size of the event depends on the capacity of the organization team and the financing.

Furthermore, the duration of the event must be defined in the conceptual phase. Is one day enough? Two days? A long weekend? Or do I have the possibility to organize a multi-day event during the week or during the holidays? These questions can not be answered in general, but are related to other variables, such as: Can we finance an event over the appropriate period? Do we as an organization team have the time to manage the planned scope of the event? And: Is mentor coverage ensured over the entire period? In the end, in addition to the financial resources, it is also crucial how much time can be expected from the mentors (presumably working as volunteers).

The conceptual phase also involves identifying partners for the acquisition of mentors and participants, as well as identifying potential partners for content and logistical cooperation (for example, *FabLabs* for the hardware aspects).

The concept also includes a coherent financing model. An example how this could look like and what needs to be considered, especially with respect to the target groups of participants and mentors, is described in chapter 3.3.

A good concept thus clearly defines a process towards the event, but leaves the contents and the result open. How can I find out if my concept is good and appropriate? Ultimately, it takes the already described courage to risk not knowing the end results. However, it is recommended to give the concept a kind of *peer review*, which means that the concept should be read by experienced people, to ask for and incorporate constructive feedback. A good concept should therefore be put in writing in all aspects, at least on a key points level.
