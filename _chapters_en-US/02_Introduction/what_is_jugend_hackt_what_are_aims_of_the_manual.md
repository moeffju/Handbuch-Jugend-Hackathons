"Jugend hackt" is a support program for young computer enthusiasts aged between 12 and 18 years. Started in 2013 with a pilot hackathon, in order to first validate the demand for such an event, "Jugend hackt" was overwhelmed by the interest. Since then, the program has been steadily expanded in depth and breadth. However, the core element of "Jugend hackt" were and still are regularly held events in the form of youth hackathons.

"Jugend hackt" is characterized by three objectives: 1) promote the technical skills of programmers, 2) connect young people to one another, and 3) identify socially relevant questions and problems. Since the beginning of the program, the focus has also been on the ethics of hacking.

However, one thing the manual is not is permission to run events called "Jugend hackt". Our aim is to share the knowledge gained by "Jugend hackt" about how to successfully execute youth hackathons, in order to encourage all interested parties to implement this new format.
