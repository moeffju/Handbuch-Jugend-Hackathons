Hackathons are characterized by their clearly defined format and product orientation: within a fixed period of time, work on interdisciplinary teams is usually carried out on a specific product. This is presented to a (part of the) public at the end of the process of brainstorming and hacking. The software or hardware hacks shown are required to be functional, but may still be in a prototype stage.

Incentives to participate in (usually free, but also unpaid) hackathons are created by making available previously unpublished data, non-publicly accessible technologies or in some cases (and partly, very high amounts of) prize money. This is awarded by a jury of experts at the end of the hackathon, after the presentation. The identification with the group, new cooperations and also sharing the event are centered very strongly on the products.
