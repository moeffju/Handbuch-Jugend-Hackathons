This manual is aimed at professionals in (political) education, youth work, and technology activism who want to support young people in the development of their technical skills. It aims to facilitate entry into the format of the youth hackathon format and document past experience. The handbook does not provide basic answers to all the questions on the subjects involved, but rather focuses on the specific questions of (youth) hackathons. We recommend the handbook to teams with previous experience in the organization of (educational) events and working with multiprofessional teams, as recommended in Chapter 3.2: Roles and Competences in the Team.
