Hackathons have become established in the software and hardware sector as a format to quickly create innovation and to encourage networking among actors. From the perspective of the respective organizers, there are a number of different goals.

Corporations organize hackathons to advertise their products, get in touch with new developers, close security gaps, or promote innovative approaches around their products.

The free software and hardware developer community hosts hackathons to network with or expand their own community. Most developers use hackathons to network, meet like-minded people, and expand their own abilities. There is also a high motivation in developer circles to find solutions to new or unresolved problems.
